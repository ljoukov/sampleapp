The app takes natural language query, eg:

> Make a table with my stock portfolio: META, TSLA, AMZN, VUAA, NVDA, GOOGL. Show symbol, number of shares, amount invested, and current stock price. Add a total at the end.

It translates this query into code which is executed on Daytona.

The trick is to make whole system work:
- add requirements specific to Daytona (Python light-weight virtual machine)
- provide APIs such as for stock data

Note: the app is 1990s stylized :) that's why output is textual, this is all deliberate :)
